##### Compose Efficient and Scalable Software
Designed software solutions that are scalable, leveraging C# features and standard programming practices for optimal performance across tasks.

##### Analyze Algorithm Complexity
Evaluated the efficiency of algorithms using Big-O notation, ensuring informed decisions about performance and resource utilization.

##### Apply Transferable Industry Skills
Enhanced problem-solving, critical thinking, and software development skills applicable to both academic and professional settings.

## Key Project Components
##### Task 1: Object-Oriented Programming in C#
###### Student Class:
Implemented with properties (Name, ID, Age) and a GetInformation() method.
Created an array of 10 Student objects and displayed their details using GetInformation().
Technologies: C#, .NET Console Application

###### Task 2: Queue Implementation
###### Simple Queue:
Added and removed customers from a queue.
Displayed queue contents and total customer count.
###### Circular Queue:
Allowed reversing the order of the first k elements.
Technologies: C#, Windows Forms or Console Application

##### Task C: Binary Tree Traversal and Algorithms
###### Binary Tree Traversal:
Implemented InOrder, PreOrder, and PostOrder methods.
###### Binary Search:
Added a Contains() method to search for specific nodes.
###### String Algorithms on Trees:
Implemented methods like Longest() (find the longest string) and Ancestor() (find the first common ancestor).
Technologies: C#, .NET Console Application

###### Task 3: Dictionary-Based Student Management
###### Student Management System:
Used Dictionary to manage students by unique ID.
Implemented CRUD operations and displayed students with active enrollment.

###### Task 4: Graph Implementation
###### Directed Graph:
Nodes represented by the GraphNode class with adjacency lists.
Implemented methods to add nodes, edges, and count nodes/edges.
###### Social Network Application:
Managed a social network graph.
Displayed direct and indirect friends of a person.
Allowed the addition and removal of persons.

Time Complexity: 
ùëÇ(ùëõ2)
The nested loop runs 
ùëõ√óùëõ times, where n is the input size.
###### Segment 2 (Sequential Loops)
Time Complexity: 
ùëÇ(ùëö)
The for loop runs 
ùëö times.
The while loop also runs 
ùëö times sequentially.
